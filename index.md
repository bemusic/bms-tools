bms-tools
=========

These are the tools I use to make BMS.

Online Tools
------------

* [__Sound Matcher__](compiler.html): matches notes with keysound

Offline Tools
-------------

These are advanced tools I use to slice sounds to create key sounds and note patterns.

* [__slicer2__](https://github.com/bemusic/bms-tools/tree/master/slicer2): advanced command-line sound slicer
* [__miditext2__](https://github.com/bemusic/bms-tools/tree/master/miditext2): convert MIDI files to sound slices
